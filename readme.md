## dovecot - simulation/hardware experiments on dynamixel/vrep robots

The `dovecot` library was written to launch scientific experiments involving hardware, simulated and hybrid robots.

This code was designed and written to conduct specific scientific experiments. It is probably not fit for any other purpose, and certainly not for production environments. In particular, its maintenance and development depend on the direction of future research. That being said, do not hesitate to submit issues or contact me by mail for questions and comments.
